It’s a frustration we can all relate to… Painstakingly spelling out your email letter-by-letter over the phone – racking your brain to remember your Alpha-Bravo-Charlies – only to have the caller ring you back because the email bounced.

Haystack’s latest feature lets you avoid all that.

The ‘H for Haystack’ feature utilises world-first technology to save you the annoyance of relaying lengthy emails, names or URLs over the phone and instead sends the caller all your particulars mid-conversation at the click of a button.

It also prevents the frequent misspellings that result from spelling out your details, with letters and sounds being so easily confused or distorted by background noise.

With the Haystack app downloaded on your phone, whenever you’re speaking with someone who asks for your email, address or any other contact detail for that matter, it’s a quick click to send those details via text message directly to your caller instantaneously.

Before you’ve even finished your conversation, your contact details will be sitting there on their phone waiting for them.

It’s a faster, easier and more accurate approach to sharing your particulars over the phone. Because let’s face it, most of us don’t have a military-precision recall of the phonetic alphabet and rolling out a pre-school friendly ‘A as in apple, B as in ball’ can leave you looking less professional, and more like a children’s television show host.

The ‘H for Haystack’ feature is available now for Android users only as part of the Haystack app – Enjoy!
