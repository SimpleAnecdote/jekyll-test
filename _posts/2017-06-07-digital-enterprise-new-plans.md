For the past few months we have been working in stealth mode on our business and enterprise plans which offer a set of features and tools tailored to large enterprise clients.
 
We quietly tested the waters and revealed more and more features like the ability to deploy beautifully branded digital business cards across large teams, link with corporate CRMs, deploy smart e-mail signatures etc. 
 
Few months later, and with large global 500 companies on board, we are ready to tell you all about it!

 
## So what's new?
 
While Haystack was and will remain a cheaper and eco-friendly alternative to traditional paper cards, it is now stylish and smarter than before:

 
### An admin dashboard - 
- Create templates for your digital business cards and deploy them across your teams in minutes.
- Take control over your brand identity and personnel permissions.
- Add social channels, image galleries & video channels, and know it will always stay up-to-date.
- Add or remove employees in seconds - Your new employees will get their unlimited supply of digital business cards on their first day of work and the ones that leave will not take your valuable contact list with them.

 
### Connecting With Your CRM
With the Haystack app at the fingertips of each of your employees, they can now scan all of their received business cards by simply taking a photo of it with their smartphone. Sync yours and your employees' new connections directly into the corporate CRM as a new contact or a lead.

 
### Helping your emails stand out
Put a face to your employees with Haystack's smart Email Signatures. Make it more personal and memorable and be ready to get some great feedback.

 
### Providing you with analytics
Get some insights into your employees and their contacts usage patterns (we have more analytics and data enhancements lined up so stay tuned).

 
### Dedicated support
Our new Client Success team is here to help you in every step of the way.

 
### Pricing Plans that fits your business
Not all businesses created equally and so do our plans. We cater for any type or size of business. If you have less than 100 employees you can [check out these pricing plans here](https://thehaystackapp.com/pricing) and if your business is bigger we would be more than happy to work with you on a plan that suits your needs. Just [contact us](mailto:sales+enterprise@thehaystackapp.com) and we will get back to you immediately.

 
Hope you like these new additional features. As always, we are very open to feedback and suggestions so feel free to [shoot us an email](mailto:sales+enterprise@thehaystackapp.com) if you have any.
