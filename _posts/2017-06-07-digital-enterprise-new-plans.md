For the past few months, we have been working in stealth mode on our business and enterprise plans which offer a set of features and tools tailored to large enterprise clients.
 
We quietly tested the waters and revealed more and more features like the ability to deploy beautifully branded digital business cards across large teams, link with corporate CRMs, deploy smart e-mail signatures, etc. 
 
Several months later, and with large global 500 companies on board, we are ready to tell you all about it!

 
## So, what's new?
 
While Haystack was and will remain a cheaper and eco-friendly alternative to traditional paper cards, it is now more stylish and smarter than before:

 
### An admin dashboard - 
- Create templates for your digital business cards and deploy them across your teams in minutes.
- Take control over your brand identity and personnel permissions.
- Add social channels, image galleries & video channels, and know it will always stay up-to-date.
- Add or remove employees in seconds - Your new employees will get their unlimited supply of digital business cards on their first day of work, and the ones that leave will not take your valuable contact list with them.

 
### Connecting with your CRM
With the Haystack app at the fingertips of each of your employees, they can now scan all their received business cards by simply snapping a photo of each with their smartphone. You may sync yours and your employees' new connections directly into the corporate CRM as a new contact or lead.

 
### Helping your emails stand out
Put a face to your employees with Haystack's Smart Email Signatures. Make messages more personal and memorable and be ready to get some great feedback.

 
### Providing you with analytics
Gain insights into your employees and their contacts' usage patterns (we have more analytics and data enhancements lined up, so stay tuned)!

 
### Dedicated support
Our new Client Success Team is here to help you every step of the way.

 
### Pricing plans that fit your business
Not all businesses are created equal, and neither are our plans. We cater to any type or size of business. If you have fewer than than 100 employees, you can [check out these pricing plans here](https://thehaystackapp.com/pricing).

We hope you enjoy these new additional features. As always, we are very open to feedback and suggestions - so feel free to [shoot us an email](mailto:sales+enterprise@thehaystackapp.com) if you have any!
