# Frequently Asked Questions



## Who is it for?

If you need a business card then Haystack is for you - no matter how small or big your business is.

Haystack is meant to replace your need for paper so you will never forget your card or lose other people's cards again.

Going digital also means getting smarter about the way you manage your contacts, updating your personal details and tracking your results. 

And...Haystack cards are made to stand out, so if you want to impress the people you meet and put a face to your details - you came to the right place! [Click here](/) and check it out for yourself.



## Will I still need paper cards?

It's totally up to you. Our goal is to eliminate paper cards and create a smarter and more impressive way to share your details (plus being eco-friendly).

Most of our users report back that after sharing their card three times, they can't even think about using paper cards again. However we get that everyone is different and you can always carry a few with you "just in case you meet someone who doesn't own a phone"... 

Give it a go and see if you could also let go of paper - [start your free trial here.](/pricing)



## Who can I share it with? Do they need the app as well?

You can share it with anyone!

Doesn't matter what phone they have, whether they have the app, or what shoes they are wearing - your Haystack card will just magically work.

Ps. the recipients would not be required to sign up to anything, or download an app. Just your contact details - front and center!



## How can I share my card?
