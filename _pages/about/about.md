# Meet the Haystackers

Haystack was started in 2014 by a team of three brothers and a friend who believe that the time for business cards to be disrupted is finally here.

We wanted to create a seamless experience that that is better than paper. That meant removing all existing barriers of card sharing, storing and usage, and making the process as simple as possible. 

After a year of development, the backing of investors who understand the big task at hand, and joined by a team of the most talented individuals we've ever met, we have created a platform that does just that.

We are Haystack and we are here to make digital cards smarter than ever, helping your business to stand out from the crowd and improve your sales effectiveness.
